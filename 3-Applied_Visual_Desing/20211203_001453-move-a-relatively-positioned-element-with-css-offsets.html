<!-- 
  Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS OffsetsPassed
The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

Use CSS offsets to move the h2 15 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up.

<head>
<style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;

    /* Move it 15 pixels away from left (goes right)  */

    left:15px;

    /* Move it 10 px away from bottom (goes top) */

    bottom:10px;


  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
